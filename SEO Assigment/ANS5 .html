    <p>
        A favicon in HTML is a small, iconic image that represents a website and is displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar. It helps users quickly identify and locate a specific webpage among their open tabs. Favicon files are typically in .ico format, though other image formats like .png can also be used. To add a favicon to a webpage, developers use the (link) element with the rel="icon" attribute in the HTML head section, specifying the path to the favicon file. This simple yet impactful element contributes to a website's branding and provides a polished, professional look to the user's browsing experience.</p>
