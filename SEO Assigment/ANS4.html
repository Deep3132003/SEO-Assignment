            <h2>Introduction to Semantics</h2>
            <p>Semantics in HTML refers to the meaningful structure and labeling of content on a web page. It involves using specific HTML elements like (header), (nav), (article), (section), and (footer) to accurately represent different parts of a page. For instance, (header) signifies the introductory section, (nav) represents navigation links, (article) encapsulates standalone content, and (section) groups related information. Proper semantic markup not only enhances accessibility for users with assistive technologies but also aids search engines in understanding and ranking content. By employing semantic elements, developers create web pages that are well-organized, easily navigable, and optimally interpreted by both humans and machines. This leads to improved SEO and overall user experience.</p>
